//Package models provides the core configuration and behaviour of the messages that pass through RabbitMQ.
//The config exposes the configuration needed to connect to RabbitMQ, either as a publisher, subscriber, or both.
//The model IDistributedMessage is a simple contract that every message published to RabbitMQ and consumed from RabbitMQ must adhere to.
//Known issues can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/KrylixZA/GoRabbitMqBroker/issues).
