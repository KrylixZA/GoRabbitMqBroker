// Package broker provides endpoints for the end user to connect to a RabbitMQ node or cluster with a simple and logical signature.
// The implementation of this package allows the end user to create their own publishers and subscribers to handle their interactions with RabbitMQ
// but lets the package handle the details of connecting, binding and interacting with RabbitMQ.
